        <h1>Battle Symphony</h1>
        <h3>by Linkin Park</h3>
        <p class="lyric">I got a long way to go<br>
        And a long memory<br>
        I've been searching for an answer<br>
        Always just out of reach<br>
        Blood on the floor<br>
        Sirens repeat<br>
        I've been searching for the courage<br>
        To face my enemies</p>
        <p class="chorus">When they turn down the lights<br>
        I hear my battle symphony<br>
        All the world in front of me<br>
        If my armor breaks<br>
        I'll fuse it back together<br>
        Battle symphony<br>
        Please just don't give up on me<br>
        And my eyes are wide awake</p>
        <p class="chorus-2">For my battle symphony<br>
        For my battle symphony</p>
        <p class="lyric">They say that I don't belong<br>
        Say that I should retreat<br>
        That I'm marching to the rhythm<br>
        Of a lonesome defeat<br>
        But the sound of your voice<br>
        Puts the pain in reverse<br>
        No surrender, no illusions<br>
        And for better or worse</p>
        <p class="chorus">When they turn down the lights<br>
        I hear my battle symphony<br>
        All the world in front of me<br>
        If my armor breaks<br>
        I'll fuse it back together<br>
        Battle symphony<br>
        Please just don't give up on me<br>
        And my eyes are wide awake</p>
        <p class="lyric">If I fall, get knocked down<br>
        Pick myself up off the ground<br>
        If I fall, get knocked down<br>
        Pick myself up off the ground</p>
        <p class="chorus">When they turn down the lights<br>
        I hear my battle symphony<br>
        All the world in front of me<br>
        If my armor breaks<br>
        I'll fuse it back together<br>
        Battle symphony<br>
        Please just don't give up on me<br>
        And my eyes are wide awake</p>
        <p class="chorus-2">For my battle symphony<br>
        For my battle symphony</p>
